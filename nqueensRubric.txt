        NQueens Grading Rubric


Points:

  Correctness (meets specification)                                 25 / 40

  ==> It was not submitted correctly, so I didn't even know about
      it until after final grades were due.

  ==> It would not load into hugs; even after I turned <<<< HEAD and
      such into comments, it complained that compareLoc was multiply
      defined.

      On further analysis, nqueens.hs appears to be something like
      a diff file (for a merge conflict?).

      When I divided it up into 2 files, the file that represented the second
      half worked.

  ==> The output type does not meet the problem specification.

  Internal documentation                                             4 /  5

  ==> Lots of comments, although they're hard to read (thank goodness
      for syntax coloring)

  Test cases                                                         0 /  5
        (Unit tests, including boundary cases)

  Total:                                                            29 / 50
